# bash

## Why?
Get to know your shell, which is the command interpreter for many variants of
Unix. This means, Linux[]; \*BSD, and mac OS all use bash as the default login command
interpreter.

## History / sh vs bash
The Unix operating system was first written in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis
Ritchie.[] \(Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie are the authors of both Unix and C
language; however, Thompson was more of the Unix developer and Ritchie more the
C language developer\( Thompson, in August 1969, when his wife was on vacation
with his newborn son, wrote the first version of Unix...

> I allocated a week each to the operating system, the shell, the editor and the
> assembler [he told me]... and during the month she was gone, it was totally
> rewritten in a form that looked like an operating system, with tools that were
> sort of known, you know, assembler, editor, and shell -- if not maintaining
> itself, right on the verge of maintaining itself
-- Ken Thompson, describing the origin story of Unix

This original Unix shell is called the Thompson shell. Shell redirection was an
early feature of the shell, and was present for the Version 1 Unix, released on
November 3, 1971. Additionally, some tools included in this first release were
(you may have heard of these):
- cal
- cat
- chdir (later shortened to cd)
- chmod / chown
- cp
- date
- df
- du
- ed (the ancestor of vi/vim: the ancestry is: ed (editor)
                                            -> em (editor for "mortals")
                                            -> en
                                            -> ex ("extended" en)
                                            -> vi (visual)
                                            -> vim (vi "improved") )
- ls
- mkdir
- su

Pipes were added in the Unix Version 3, released February 1973.

The Thompson shell was intentially minimalistic, was inadequate for programming
tasks (such as flow control statements such as `if`). In Version 7 Unix
(released 1979), the Thompson shell was replaced by the Bourne shell (authored
by Steven Bourne). The Bourne shell made the shell more like a programming
language, by adding features like adding flow control (`if`/`else`,`case`),
variables, i/o redirection (`>&2`,`2>&1`,`2>my-errors.log`), and the like.

Due to the Unix wars, an uncertainty of being able to use Unix in the future
because of copywrite / licencing issues, Richard Stallman (founder of the GNU
project), began writing open-source replicas of the Unix kernel and Unix tools
(Unix is and was propreitary software) without any of the Unix source code.
These tools included the C compiler (`gcc`), the C standard library (`glibc`),
the core binary executables such as `sed`, bundled in a package called
`coreutils`, and of course, my personal favorite, bash.

## What you need to know (main body of the article)
I assume you are already know your way around bash, so I will skip much of the
basic content. However, if you want to brush up, [find good link] is a good
place to start

### Friendly interactive behavior
Here are some settings I add to my `~/.profile` (where you place bash settings,
that bash looks for when it starts up):

```bash
bind 'set show-all-if-ambiguous on'
bind 'TAB:menu-complete'
bind 'set completion-ignore-case on'
bind 'set visible-stats on'
bind 'set page-completions off'
```

If you use TAB to autocomplete filename, you will find this behavior much
easier to use, and if you are familiar with zsh, this will make bash feel more
like zsh. Instead of having to press tab twice; it will let you press TAB once
to autocomplete. A great improvement! Additionally, there will be no more bell
sound. Also, it will show you a list of files that match your autocomplete, and
let you cycle through them with TAB until you get your match.

Note complete list of files shown with just one TAB press after typing "cat [TAB]"
```bash
@mbp2:src $ cat
athena*      athena.user* email*
@mbp2:src $ cat athena
```

### Exit codes
A bash script will by default not exit if an error from a program has been
thrown (not the same as a syntax error); it will continue on interpreting. This
is not normally the case with most other programming languages. This can lead
to unexpected behavior in bash scripts. A sane default I use that the top of my
scripts (in addition to the shebang) is:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
```

`set -e` (from `man bash`) is: exit immediately if a pipeline (which man
consist of a single shell command... exits with a non-zero status.

`set -u` (from `man bash`) Treat unset variables as an error when performing
parameter expansion.

`set -o pipefail` (from `man bash`) The return value ... is the value of the
last command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the
pipeline exit succesfully.

Bash, and many other programming languages have the concept of exit codes. The
exit code of the prior command is stored in the $? variable. Exit codes 1 - 2,
126 - 165, and 255 all have special meanings, and should only be called if the
command warrants that exit code. Any exit code can be thrown however, as demonstrated by the following:

```
@mbp2:~ $ /usr/local/bin/bash -c 'exit 0'; echo $?
0
@mbp2:~ $ /usr/local/bin/bash -c 'exit 1'; echo $?
1
@mbp2:~ $ /usr/local/bin/bash -c 'exit 12'; echo $?
12
```

### Variables



### Style guide
- indentation: 2 spaces
- no tabs
- variables, functions, and file names all have descriptive names, unless using
  standard convention (using i in for loop, i being the incrementor)
- use `"$(command substitution)"` instead of `\`backticks`\`
- variables with no variable access in single quotes, variables with variable
  expansion with double quotes. ie `base_url='https://www.codementor.io'` and
  `full_url="${url}/${endpoint}?${query_parameters}"`

### Named arguments
Bash uses positional arguments for function declarations and function calls.
However, many command line programs offer flags to pass in content or optional
behavior. Here is a nice way to get that same behavior with your own custom
bash scripts:

```bash
tmp_dir="$(mkdir -p /tmp/email && echo '/tmp/email')"
report=''
distro_list=''
html=''
date_override=''
body_override=''

usage(){
  echo "Usage: email: ${0} [--report <file_path>] [--distro-list <'distro@list.com'>]" 1>&2
  echo "                   [--html] [--date-override <date>] [--body-override <body>]" 1>&2
  echo "       Do not use --html and body override in the same call.                 " 1>&2
  exit 1
}
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  case "$1" in
    -r|--report)        report="$2";        shift ;;
    -l|--distro-list)   distro_list="$2";   shift ;;
    -h|--html)          html='y' ;;
    -d|--date-override) date_override="$2"; shift;;
    -b|--body-override) body_override="$2"; shift;;
    *) break ;;
  esac
  shift
done
if [[ -z $report ]] || [[ -z $distro_list ]]; then usage; fi
if [[ ! -z $html ]] && [[ ! -z $body_override ]]; then usage; fi

email(){
  local report="$1"
  local distro_list="$2"
  local html="$3"
  local date_override="$4"
  local body_override="$5"

  if [[ $(whoami) == 'root' ]]; then            # docker (k8s, odroid, pi)
    curl_email "$report" "$distro_list" "$html" "$date_override" "$body_override"
  elif [[ $(whoami) == 'sbx_'* ]]; then         # AWS Lambda
    curl_email "$report" "$distro_list" "$html" "$date_override" "$body_override"
  elif [[ $(whoami) == 'skilbjo' ]]; then       # mac OS
    curl_email "$report" "$distro_list" "$html" "$date_override" "$body_override"
    #mutt_email "$report" "$distro_list" "$html" "$date_override" "$body_override"
  fi
}

email "$report" "$distro_list" "$html" "$date_override" "$body_override"
```

In the above script: I declare my global functions at the top of the script but
initalize them with empty values. I then use a function that specificies usage
and exits with an error (a common pattern in command line programs). I then use
a while statement to parse the "$@" arguments (similar to `argc`/`argv` pattern
in C language's `main` argument parsing, and based on the flags, set the global
variables with the appropriate arguments. Then, I check if required arguments
have been set, and if not, call my usage function (which will exit the script with an error code).
Next, I have the logic of the script declared as functions, and
finally, I call my main function (in this case, the function is called `email`,
which enters the logic section (in this case, a script to send a custom email).


### Sourcing files

### Aliases (you can inline a function!)

### Dotfiles + Github / Dropbox

Other shells
- ash / dash: almquist shell / debian almquist shell
- zsh: z shell
- ksh: korn shell
- tcsh: c shell
- fish: a modern shell

[]Linux: Linux is custom so distribution maintainers may craft special versions of Linux that may not use Bash. An example is Alpine Linux, the default distribution meant for Docker containers, which uses almquist shell (a lightweight clone of the Bourne Shell)
[] Linux is also referred to as GNU/Linux
[]Unix itself was spun from a project, Multics [Multiplexed Information and Computing Service],
which itself was spun from a project at MIT called CTSS [Compatible Time-Sharing System] - an
incredible video from 1963 is on youtube describing the reason why an operating system is important
and how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q07PhW5sCEk
