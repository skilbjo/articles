## What is it

## History and background
### Bell Labs
The French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell $10,000 for the invention of the
telephone; which Bell used to fund the Volta Laboratory. In 1925, the engineering
department of the American Telephone & Telegraph company and Western Electric Laboratories
consolidated to form a seperate entity; ownership of which was shared by AT&T and Western
Electric.

8 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to people for work completed at Bell Labs. Noteably,
in 1947 the transistor was invented my John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and William
Bradford Shockley. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were awarded in in the early 80s
for their work on operating system theory and for developing Unix.


### Unix family tree
Dates are when development work first started; not release date.

Pre history (processing one program):
- (1860) Analytical Engine -> Charles Babage & Ada Lovelace (gears, cogs, wheels)
- (1907) Vacuum tube
- (1940) Plugboards (vacuum tubes replacing mechanical relays)
- (1947) Transistor
- (1958) Integrated circuit

(batch processing -> multiprogramming -> time sharing)
- (1957) Atlas Supervisor & BESYS (Bell Operating System)
- (1961) Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS)
- (1964) Multics
- (1969) UNIX -> (1978) *BSD -> (1987) Mach -> (2000) Darwin
- (1985) Plan 9
- (1987) Minix
- (1991) Linux
- (1996) Inferno
